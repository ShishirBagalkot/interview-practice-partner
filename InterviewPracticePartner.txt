Overview
Features
an agent that helps users prepare for job interviews:
	● Conduct mock interviews for specific roles (e.g. sales, engineer, retail associate)

	● Provide post-interview feedback on responses and identify areas for improvement
		(communication, technical knowledge, etc.)
	● Interaction Mode: Voice preferred, chat acceptable

Some Free / Open-Source LLMs You Can Use
Here are a few LLMs that are open-source and free to use (subject to their respective licenses), and which are quite suitable for a chatbot / interview-agent:
Model	Why It’s Good for Your Use-Case	Trade-offs / Requirements
Mistral 7B	Very capable, good instruction-following, not too big.	Needs decent compute; but quantized versions (e.g. GGUF) make local inference more feasible. 
LLaMA (e.g. LLaMA 3)	Well-supported, good balance of performance and size. 
	Model size matters — smaller versions are easier to run locally. Also, license restrictions for some LLaMA versions.
Gemma (DeepMind)	Lightweight, newer, well optimized. 
	May not be as “chat-optimized” as instruction-fine-tuned chat models; quantization might help.
Falcon (7B / 40B / 180B)	Powerful, especially for reasoning tasks. 
	Very large models (40B / 180B) need lots of memory / GPU. Use smaller or quantized versions for local.
BLOOM	Multilingual + large. 
	Huge model size (depending on variant), may be overkill and hard to run locally unless you have strong hardware.

System architecture (components & flow)

Frontend (React) — chat UI, role selection, question flow, input box, feedback panel, replay / history view, record audio for voice mode.

Backend (Node/Express or Python/Flask) — session management, role/question templates, scoring logic, persisted transcripts, prompts orchestration.

LLM API — conversational model (GPT-style) for question generation, follow-ups, evaluation and feedback.

STT / TTS service (optional) — convert user voice → text (STT) and LLM text → audio (TTS). Web Speech API can be used for quick local demo.

Database (SQLite/Postgres) — sessions, transcripts, user profile, role templates, previous attempts.

Authentication (optional) — single-user demo can skip; multi-user demo add JWT + OAuth.
